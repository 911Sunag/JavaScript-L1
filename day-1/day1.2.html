    <!-- A variable is a named container that stores a value of a specific data type 
    
    data-types:
    1.Number(0,40,52,69 or 3.14, 9.8).
    2.String("javaScript" or 'javaScript').
    3.boolean(true or false).
    4.undefined
    5.null
    6.object(An Object is a more complex data type that can hold collections of key-value pairs.)
    example:

    let book = {
      title:"The come into void",
      author: "Sunag.a",
      year:2025
    };
    In this object, title, author, and year are the keys (or property names). 
    The come into void, Sunag.a, and 2025 are the corresponding values.
    7.Symbol(A Symbol is a special type of value in JavaScript that is always unique and cannot be changed. It's often used to create unique labels or identifiers for properties)
    8.BigInt

    

    Variables

    variables act as containers for storing data that you can access and modify throughout your program.

    You can think of variables as boxes that hold values.

    example: 
        let age = 25;
        One advantage of using the let keyword to declare variables is that you can reassign values to them. In programming, reassignment means giving a new value to a variable that already has one.
        let age = 30;

        const maxScore = 100;
        const is used to declare variables that are constant. Once you assign a value to a variable declared with const, you cannot reassign it.
