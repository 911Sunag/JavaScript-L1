     ternary operator is a compact way to write simple if/else statements.
      condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;

      example:
      const weather = temperature > 25 ? 'sunny' : 'cool';

      console.log(`It's a ${weather} day!`);

      If temperature is greater than 25, the code above logs It's a sunny day!. If temperature is ever less than 25, it logs It's a cool day!.

      The logical AND operator is useful when you want to check multiple conditions and ensure that all are true before proceeding. &&

      The logical OR operator checks if at least one of the operands is truthy. If the first operand is truthy, it returns that value: ||
